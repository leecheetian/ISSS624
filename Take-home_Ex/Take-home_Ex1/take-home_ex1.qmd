# Geospatial Analytics for Social Good

## Objective

To reveal the geospatial patterns of Not Functional water points in Nigeria using global and local spatial association techniques.

## Loading R Packages

```{r}
pacman::p_load(sf, spdep, tmap, tidyverse)
```

## Importing Data into R

### The Data

![](nigeria%20adm2%20geospatial%20data.jpg)

![](nigeria%20aspatial%20data.jpg)

### Importing shapefile and Transforming to EPSG 26391 Map Projection

```{r}
nigeria_sf <- st_read(dsn="data/Nigeria", layer="geoBoundaries-NGA-ADM2")
```

```{r}
plot(nigeria_sf)
```

```{r}
glimpse(nigeria_sf)
```

```{r}
nigeria26391 <- st_transform(nigeria_sf, crs = 26391)
nigeria26391
```

### Importing Aspatial Data

```{r}
WPdx_csv <- read_csv("data/WPdx+/Water_Point_Data_Exchange_-_Plus__WPdx__.csv")
```

#### Data Wrangling

Retrieving data for Nigeria only and where functional status is known.

```{r}
nigeria_data <- WPdx_csv %>%
  filter(`#country_name` == "Nigeria") %>%
  drop_na(`#status`) %>%
  group_by(`#adm2`) %>%
  mutate(`functionality` = case_when(grepl("^Functional", `#status`) 
                                     ~ "Functional", 
                                     TRUE ~ "Non-functional")) %>%
  count(`functionality`) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = `functionality`, values_from = n) %>%
  mutate(`f2nfrate` = ifelse(!is.na(`Functional`) & !is.na(`Non-functional`), 
                             `Functional` / `Non-functional`,
                              ifelse(!is.na(`Functional`), 
                                     `Functional`, 0)))
```

```{r}
nigeria_data
```

The following assumptions were taken in the calculation of the Functional-to-Non-functional ratio, *f2nfrate*, of the water points in each Local Government Area (LGA):

-   For LGAs with both Functional and Non-functional water point records, the *f2nfrate* is calculated by the count of the former divided by the count of the latter.

-   For LGAs with only Functional water point records but no Non-functional water point records, the *f2nfrate* is assigned the count of the Functional water points (ie. assuming the Non-functional water point count is 1), as it is not feasible to divide by 0.

-   For LGAs with only Non-functional water point records and no Functional water point records, the *f2nfrate* is assigned as 0.

### Joining the Aspatial Data and the Geospatial Data

```{r}
nigeria_WPdx <- left_join(nigeria26391, nigeria_data, 
                          by = c("shapeName" = "#adm2"))
```

```{r}
nigeria_WPdx
```

```{r}
write_rds(nigeria_WPdx, "data/rds/nigeria_WPdx.rds")
```

```{r}
nigeria_WPdx <- read_rds("data/rds/nigeria_WPdx.rds")
```

```{r}
nigeria_WPdx
```

## Plotting Thematic Map of Water Point Data

```{r}
fmap <- tm_shape(nigeria_WPdx) +
  tm_polygons("Functional", title = "Functional count", 
              style = "jenks", palette = "Blues", n = 6, border.alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE)
  
nfmap <- tm_shape(nigeria_WPdx) +
  tm_polygons("Non-functional", title = "Non-functional count", 
              style = "jenks", palette = "Oranges", n = 6, border.alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE)

f2nfmap <- tm_shape(nigeria_WPdx) +
  tm_polygons("f2nfrate", title = "Functional to Non-functional ratio", 
              style = "jenks", palette = "Greens", n = 6, border.alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE) 

tmap_arrange(fmap, nfmap, f2nfmap, ncol=1)
```

It appears the functional water points are mostly concentrated in the northern regions of Nigeria, and corresponds to a higher functional-to-non-functional ratio. The central and southern regions see a higher number of non-functional water points and lower functional-to-non-functional ratio in contrast.
